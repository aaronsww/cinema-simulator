# Cinema Simulator

### Note: This project is still under construction

This project is a cinema theatre simulator app built using Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. The main purpose of this app is to provide a more intuitive way for users to select seats when booking online tickets through visualising and representing the theatre and seats in a 3D environment.
